Fluxion is the future of MITM WPA attacks  Fluxion is a security auditing and social-engineering research tool. It is a remake of linset by vk496 with (hopefully) less bugs and more functionality. The script attempts to retrieve the WPA/WPA2 key from a target access point by means of a social engineering (phishing) attack. It's compatible with the latest release of Kali (rolling). Fluxion's attacks' setup is mostly manual, but experimental auto-mode handles some of the attacks' setup parameters. Read the FAQ before requesting issues.  If you need quick help, fluxion is also avaible on gitter. You can talk with us on Gitter or on Discord. Installation  Read here before you do the following steps. Download the latest revision  git clone --recursive git@github.com:FluxionNetwork/fluxion.git   Switch to tool's directory  cd fluxion   Run fluxion (missing dependencies will be auto-installed)  ./fluxion.sh  Fluxion is also available in arch  cd bin/arch makepkg  or using the blackarch repo  pacman -S fluxion  scroll Changelog  Fluxion gets weekly updates with new features, improvements, and bugfixes. Be sure to check out the changelog here. :octocat: How to contribute  All contributions are welcome! Code, documentation, graphics, or even design suggestions are welcome; use GitHub to its fullest. Submit pull requests, contribute tutorials or other wiki content -- whatever you have to offer, it'll be appreciated but please follow the style guide. book How it works      Scan for a target wireless network.      Launch the Handshake Snooper attack.      Capture a handshake (necessary for password verification).      Launch Captive Portal attack.      Spawns a rogue (fake) AP, imitating the original access point.      Spawns a DNS server, redirecting all requests to the attacker's host running the captive portal.      Spawns a web server, serving the captive portal which prompts users for their WPA/WPA2 key.      Spawns a jammer, deauthenticating all clients from original AP and lureing them to the rogue AP.      All authentication attempts at the captive portal are checked against the handshake file captured earlier.      The attack will automatically terminate once a correct key has been submitted.      The key will be logged and clients will be allowed to reconnect to the target access point.      For a guide to the Captive Portal attack, read the Captive Portal attack guide  exclamation Requirements  A Linux-based operating system. We recommend Kali Linux 2 or Kali rolling. Kali 2 &amp; rolling support the latest aircrack-ng versions. An external wifi card is recommended. Related work  For development I use vim and tmux.
